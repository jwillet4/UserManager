# UserManager
Source code for a code challenge given to me by BlueMatrix

## MySql Server
This application uses a connection string for an instance of mysql server via a user with the credentials username = root and password = root. The database will be generated by going into that mysql server instance and running the usergen.sql file included in the repo.

## API Layer
For this project, I decided to use .NET Core's WebAPI. To start the back-end, change into the usermanagerserver directory and run the following command:
`$ dotnet run`
This will run the project locally at port 5001.

## Front-End
For this, I decided to use Angular with Kendo components for styling and functionality. To start this, navigate to the usermanager directory and run the following command:
`$ ng serve`
Once everything is compiled, you should be able to visit the site at localhost port 4200.
